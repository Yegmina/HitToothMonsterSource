# HitToothMonsterSource

Greetings everyone!
This is the official global channel of the flip game "HitToothMonster".

Brief description:
Hit the popping toothy monsters quickly and accurately for high scores!

What makes our game special:

Are you bored of the same type of games that blindly imitate Notcoin and Hamster? Then you have come to the right address!

In our game, you don't have to stupidly click on one point on the screen! Instead, there are 3 by 3 holes in which monsters climb out at random times. You need to have time to click on them until they hide back. But be careful: there are special monsters that add or subtract HP!

You also need to collect coins that appear on the screen. They can be used to buy boosters for one game session or forever (more about this later). And not only that)
